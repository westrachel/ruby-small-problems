# Bonus Features:
# i. Call total method fewer times and instead assign total
#    to a variable and make sure this variable is updated
#    where necessary
#
# ii. Extract scoreboard & final card display to methods,
#     so that there is consistent output regardless if
#     someone busts or no one busts. This also avoids
#     repeating the same code to show what cards players have
#     at different points of the game.
#     Although, won't use this method to initially display the
#      Dealer's cards b/c only display the 1st Dealer card at
#      the start of the game.
#
# iii. Keep track of each player's wins. Break the game loop
#    as soon as someone reaches 5 wins. Regardless of whether
#    someone reaches 5 wins or not, display the larger game
#    scoreboard.
# iv. Whatever-one bonus feature.
#     Store the game winning amount and amount the dealer needs to
#      reach at a minimum to stop hitting as constants, so that they
#      are adjustable and could turn the game into 21, or 31, or
#      whatever-one. Make any other adjustments as necessary to have
#      game messages + busts + declare_winner methods reactive to
#      these constants.
