# expected return value: 11
# Array#pop returns the value of the last element in the array
# So, array#pop will return the String whose value is caterpillar
# The size method will the return the number of characters in the String it's called on
# caterpillar has 11 characters
# Accordingly, chaining the pop and size methods on this given array (with pop called first)
# will return the integer whose value is 11
