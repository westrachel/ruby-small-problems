#what is the main difference between an array and a hash?
# An array is a list of elements where each element can be called based on its numbered index
# in contrast a hash contains key-value pairs, so that a value can be called based on its associated key 


#Exercise 8:
#Create a hash w/ both syntaxes
#old syntax w/ the rocket:
hash1 = {"Texas" => "Austin",
  "Illinois" => "Chicago",
  "Arizona" => "Phoenix"
} 
#new syntax
hash2 = { California: "San Diego",
  Masachusetts: "Boston",
  Idaho: "Boise"
}

#Exercise 9:
hash = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4}
#(part 1) get the value of key :b
hash[:b]

#(part 2) add to this hash the key:value pair '{e:5}'
hash[:e] = 5

#(part 3) remove all key:value pairs whose value is less than 3.5
hash.each do |key, val|
  if val < 3.5
    hash.delete(key)

#Exercise 13:
#Use Ruby's Array method delete_if and String method start_with? to 
# delete all of the words that begin with an "s" in the following array.
arr = ['snow', 'winter', 'ice', 'slippery', 'salted roads', 'white trees']
arr.delete_if { |word| word.start_with?('s') }


#Exercise 14:
#given array:
a = ['white snow', 'winter wonderland', 'melting ice',
     'slippery sidewalk', 'salted roads', 'white trees']

#turn given array into a new array that consists of strings containing one word. 
#(ex. ["white snow", etc...] â†’ ["white", "snow", etc...]. 
#Look into using Array's map and flatten methods, as well as String's split method.
b = [] 
a.map { |string| b << string.split }
#in irb, b prints as an array w/ multiple arrays in it:
#=> [["white", "snow"], ["winter", "wonderland"], ["melting", "ice"], ["slippery", "sidewalk"], ["salted", "roads"], ["white", "trees"]] 
#based on ruby documentation, flatten returns a one-d array of itself 
# returning is not the same as mutating permanently, so set b = b.flatten to permanenty change b
b = b.flatten


#Exercise 15:
#what will the following return?
puts "Exericse 15: test hashes for equivalency"

hash2 = {"hat" => "adidas", :shoes => "nike", hoodie: true}  #different order than hash1, but the types are the same 
# types are the same in that each key in hash1 is of the same type as in hash2 ("hat" = string key in both and identical spelling + all lowercase)
# conclusion: only the order is different, but otherwise the hashes appear equivalent, so 
#                 I expect the code below to print "These hashes are the same!"

#Exercise 16:
#Challenge: In exercise 11, we manually set the contacts hash values one by one.
#Now, programmatically loop or iterate over the contacts hash from exercise 11, 
#and populate the associated data from the contact_data array. Hint: you will probably need to iterate over 
# ([:email, :address, :phone]), and some helpful methods might be the Array shift and first methods.
contact_data = ["joe@email.com", "123 Main st.", "555-123-4567"]
contacts = {"Joe Smith" => {}}

#solution:
#in irb, when used .shift on contact_data it permanently deleted the first element of contact_data
contact_info = { :email => "", 
  :address => "" ,
  :phone => "" }
  
contact_info.each do |k, v|
  v << contact_data.first
  contact_data.shift  #this should remove the first element of contact_data permanently, so that on each subsequent iteration 
end                   # a different element of contact_data will be assigned to a subsequent value in contact_info

#now assign contact_info hash as the value to "Joe Smith" in the original contacts hash
contacts["Joe Smith"] = contact_info 


#Exercise 16 bonus: see if you can figure out how to make it work with multiple entries in the contacts hash.
